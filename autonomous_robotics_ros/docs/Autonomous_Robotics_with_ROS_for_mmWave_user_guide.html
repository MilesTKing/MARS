Autonomous Robotics with ROS for mmWave
===========

This lab allows for the TI mmWave sensor to be used with popular mapping and navigation libraries in the Robot Operating System (ROS) environment, familiar to many robotics engineers. 
The lab uses the Octomap server and move_base libraries with TI’s mmWave ROS Driver Package software to interface to the TI mmWave sensor. The lab supports use of IWR6843ISK or IWR6843AOP ES2.0 EVMs. 
With this TI driver and the software from the ROS community (ros.org) engineers may evaluate robot navigation and object avoidance quickly and easily.

  <img src="images/mmwave_demo_visualizer_ports.png" width="600"/>


## 4. Setting up the TurtleBot2
-----------

* The TurtleBot2 is a low-cost, personal robotics platform that is well supported within the ROS
community. There are many existing demos that work out-of-the-box with the TurtleBot2 including
teleoperation (remote control), mapping, and navigation. 
* In this guide we will have a look at how to modify these demos to integrate the TI mmWave sensor as the 3-D sensor. 
* The TurtleBot2 should be assembled and mmWave EVM mounted as shown in the following pictures to work with this lab. There may be slight variation in mounting depending on EVM option.
* In the example shown, the 12V to 5V converter is mounted underneath the center of the top plate.
* The Turtlebot and EVM is connected to the laptop using USB cables

## 5. Installing ROS and the TI mmWave ROS Driver
---------------
* Please follow the instructions in the TI mmWave ROS Driver Setup Guide (available on the **TI Resource Explorer under Labs > TI mmWave ROS Driver**) to install ROS and the TI mmWave ROS Driver on each laptop before continuing. 
* ROS must be installed on both the TurtleBot laptop and the Remote Control laptop. 
* It is a good idea to test out the installation on each laptop by connecting the TI mmWave EVM and trying out the point cloud visualization.


## 6. Installing the mmWave Mapping and Navigation Demo Packages
---------------
After installing ROS and the TI mmWave ROS Driver, follow the steps below on both laptops for interchangeability.

```
```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros-planning/navigation/1.14.2/fake_localization/package.xml
```

## 7. Download the TurtleBot mmWave Mapping and Navigation Packages
---------------
1. Download the **ti\_mmwave\_ros\_map\_nav\_`<ver>`.tar.gz** Linux archive file from the 
	<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="window.parent.jumpToTirexNodeInCurrentPackage (' AN-1gXp4Kn1RRFC9mOFTZQ ')"> Robotics </a> / Autonomous Robotics with ROS for mmWave folder and copy it to your catkin `<workspace_dir>/src` directory.

[[y! Note
Downloading and extracting the TurtleBot mmWave Mapping and Navigation Packages should be done on both laptops
]]


  a) Point your web browser to the mmwave sensor software package: https://dev.ti.com/tirex/#/?link=Software 
  
  b) Click on “mmWave Sensors” and then click on “Industrial Toolbox” 
  
  c) Click on the link for “Labs”
  
  d) Click on the “Autonomous Robotics with ROS for mmWave” lab in the table in the center
  
  e) Click on the “Download All” button on the right side as shown in the following 
image and accept the user license agreement when prompted. Choose to save the
downloaded zip file if prompted or save it to disk first and then open it by doubleclicking
it from the downloaded location.
<img src="images/setup_sw/download_lab.png" class="img-responsive"/> 
  
  f) Navigate into the folder structure of the opened zip file to the path shown in the
following figure. (Note that the path may start with mmwave\_sensors/industrial\_toolbox\_<ver> depending on package version.)
<img src="images/setup_sw/ros_pkg_source.png" class="img-responsive"/> 

  g) Open a new file browser window and navigate to your catkin `<workspace_dir>/src`
directory as shown in the right window in the following screenshot. Copy the
**ti\_mmwave\_ros\_map\_nav\_`<ver>`.tar.gz** file to your `<workspace_dir>/src` directory
by dragging it from the source (left) window to the destination (right) window.
<img src="images/setup_sw/ros_pkg_dest.png" class="img-responsive"/> 

  h) You should now see the **ti\_mmwave\_ros\_map\_nav\_`<ver>`.tar.gz** file in your
`<workspace_dir>/src` directory as shown in the following screenshot.
<img src="images/setup_sw/ros_pkg_in_src.png" class="img-responsive"/> 

2. Extract the turtlebot, navigation, and turtlebot\_mmwave\_launchers folders (as well as a
custom mmWave chirp config file which gets placed in the ti_mmwave_rospkg/cfg
directory) from the archive (.tar.gz) file using the following command executed from the
`<workspace_dir>/src` directory. Change <ver> to match the actual filename.

```
$ tar xzf ti_mmwave_ros_map_nav_<ver>.tar.gz
```

3. Go back to your catkin `<workspace_dir>` directory and build the workspace:

```
$ cd <workspace_dir>
```
```
$ catkin_make
```

  If all of the installation steps were followed and both ROS environment scripts were sourced
the driver should build successfully and you should see [100%] on the lines at the end of the
build output.

## 8. Networking
---------------
ROS is a distributed system, meaning that it can communicate over a local network with other ROS
components. For this demo, both laptops mentioned above must be on the exact same network and
must be able to ping (icmp) each other by IP address. The Remote Control laptop must also be able to
ssh (tcp/ip) into the TurtleBot laptop by IP address. You may need to install ssh on the laptops using the
following command:

  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install ssh
  ```
For more information regarding ROS’s networking visit the link: <http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup>


Additionally a ROS system may only have one “roscore” across all machines. In order for machines to
recognize this “roscore” they must have an environment variable defined which specifies the IP address
of the “roscore” machine.


###On the TurtleBot machine
Edit your **~/.bashrc** file to include the following lines at the bottom:
  ```
  export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
  export ROS_IP=<IP_OF_THIS_MACHINE>
  ```
You can check your IP by running `$ ifconfig` on the command line. Note that the line
exporting the ROS_IP environment variable may not be required if your network is setup where
each machine can contact/ping the other by hostname. You must close and re-open the shell
for the updated **~/.bashrc** file to take effect.

###On the Remote machine
Edit your **~/.bashrc** file to include the following lines at the bottom:
  ```
  export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<IP_OF_TURTLEBOT_MACHINE>:11311
  export ROS_IP=<IP_OF_THIS_MACHINE>
  ```
  You can check your IP by running `$ ifconfig` on the command line. Note that if your network
is setup where each machine can contact/ping the other by hostname then you can use
<NAME_OF_TURTLEBOT_MACHINE> instead of <IP_OF_TURTLEBOT_MACHINE> in the first line
and the line exporting the ROS_IP environment variable may not be required. You must close
and re-open the shell for the updated **~/.bashrc** file to take effect.

## 9. Remote Control Demo (TurtleBot Bring-up and Teleoperation)
---------------
These steps must take place from the remote machine, “ssh-ing” into the TurtleBot laptop when
necessary.

##TurtleBot Bring-up
To start the TurtleBot, open a terminal window on the remote machine, ssh into the TurtleBot laptop
and run the following command.

  * For IWR6843ISK:
  ```
  $ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch mmwave_device:=6843ISK
  ```
  
  * For IWR6843AOP:
  ```
  $ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch mmwave_device:=6843AOP
  ```
 
If the EVM was not in a good state the roslaunch command will fail. Try resetting the EVM by pressing
the ‘NRST’ button on the EVM and then run the desired roslaunch command again.
After the Turtlebot and mmWave sensor are configured, you may see periodic “Kobuki : malformed subpayload
detected” errors. These errors appear to come from the Turtlebot driver and do not affect the
operation of the demo.

##Teleoperation (Remote Control)
Open a new terminal window on the remote machine and run the following command to bring up the
teleoperation (remote control) of the TurtleBot:  

  ```
  $ roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
  ```
  Follow the instructions shown in the window to control the TurtleBot. You can exit out of the remote
control application by pressing `CTRL-C`.

## 10. Mapping Demo
---------------
The Mapping Demo is an example of how to use TI’s mmWave Radar EVMs within the ROS framework
on a robot to build a map.

* The demo runs the octomap_server package in ROS. There are several filters that have been brought up
for use: Pass Through filters for all the point cloud fields, and a Statistical Outlier Removal filter for
filtering the raw map. 
  * **Pass Through Filters**: remove values outside a certain range for a given field (X, Y, Z, intensity)
  * **Statistical Outlier Removal**: removes values based off their distance from their closest neighbors
* The parameters/limits for these filters can be found and modified in the
**turtlebot\_mmwave\_launchers/launch/radar\_limit\_filters.launch** file. The **radar_mapping.launch** file
mentioned below must be re-started after changing the **radar_limit_filters.launch** file in order for the
new parameters to take effect.

The processing graph for the incoming point cloud data is shown below:
<img src="images/setup_sw/ros_processing_graph.png" class="img-responsive"/> 


##Start-up
To run the mapping demo, first follow the TurtleBot Bring-up and Remote Control instructions in the
“TurtleBot Bring-up and Teleoperation (Remote Control)” section to bring up and remote control the
TurtleBot. Then, to run the mapping demo open a new terminal window, ssh into the TurtleBot laptop
and run the following command:
  ```
  $ roslaunch turtlebot_mmwave_launchers radar_mapping.launch
  ```
  You may see a few warnings immediately after the launch file is run. It may also output a warning saying
“Nothing to publish, octree is empty” whenever there are no objects detected in front of the mmWave
sensor.


##Visualization
To view the TurtleBot, Radar data, and map data in Rviz open a new terminal window on the remote
machine and run the following command which will open a pre-defined Rviz configuration customized
for the mapping demo (the command is all one line):
  ```
  $ rosrun rviz rviz -d ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot_mmwave_launchers/launch/mapping_visualization.rviz
  ```
  Alternatively, you can run the following command to open a blank Rviz screen and then manually add
the same topics to the visualization as follows: 
  ```
  $ rosrun rviz rviz
  ```
  
* Once Rviz has started, add the radar data by selecting Add-> PointCloud2 and selecting /mmWaveDataHdl/RScan under the Topic dropdown menu for the PointCloud2. 
  * Make the following changes to improve the visualiation:
    * Size to 0.03
    * Style to Spheres
    * Decay to 0.25  

* To visualize the TurtleBot on the screen select Add->Robot Model and Rviz will automatically detect the robot
description and display the TurtleBot. 

* To view the path the TurtleBot is taking select Add->Path and choose /trajectory under the Topic dropdown for the Path.
* To visualize the octomap output in Rviz, select Add->PointCloud2 and select `<raw_or_filtered>_point_cloud_centers` 
  * To color points by elevation change ColorTransformer to AxisColor. 
  * Changing the Size to 0.03 and Style to Spheres will improve the visualization.

You can also save a custom Rviz configuration and load it in the future for convenience.


##Saving a Map
* The TurtleBot laptop is now running the Radar and TurtleBot drivers, as well as all the filtering and
mapping nodes shown in the flow chart above. 
* Move the TurtleBot around your environment manually until you are satisfied with your map. 
* Then open a new terminal window on the remote machine, ssh into the TurtleBot laptop, and run the following command to save the map:

```
$ rosrun octomap_server octomap_saver –f <your_file_name>.bt
```

##Viewing a Previously Saved Map
* To view a saved `<map>.bt` file, you must first shutdown the mapping demo launch file if it was launched
by pressing CTRL-C in the window where the radar_mapping.launch file was launched. 
* Rviz will need to be opened and configured as mentioned in the Visualization section above if it is not already open.
* Then, open a new terminal window on the remote machine, ssh into the TurtleBot laptop, and run the following command to serve the saved map (the command is all one line):
```
$ rosrun octomap_server octomap_server_node /path/to/<map>.bt octomap_point_cloud_centers:=filtered_point_cloud_centers
```
You should see the saved map displayed in Rviz. Note that the other topics in Rviz may show a
warning/error since they are not active.


## 11. Navigation Demo
---------------
The TurtleBot navigation demo runs on the nodes mentioned in the image below.
<img src="images/setup_sw/ros_nodes.png" class="img-responsive"/> 

Here are the steps to run the navigation demo.
1. Close all previous terminal windows if any were open

2. Open a new terminal window on the remote machine, ssh into the TurtleBot laptop and bring up the
TurtleBot and mmWave EVM with the following command.
  * For IWR6843ISK:  
  ```
	$ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch mmwave_device:=6843ISK
  ```

  * For IWR6843AOP:  
  ```
	$ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch mmwave_device:=6843AOP
  ```

  
  If the EVM was not in a good state the roslaunch command will fail. Try resetting the EVM by
pressing the ‘NRST’ button on the EVM and then run the desired roslaunch command again.

  The configuration files are included in the ti_mmwave_ros_map_nav_v1p4.tar.gz package ...\ti_mmwave_ros_map_nav_v1p4\ti_mmwave_rospkg\cfg. To change the parameter, edit and save the file using a text editor. For example, to update the demo to run using the IWR6843ISK-ODS and configuration file used with the ODS point cloud demo 
    - Edit the "6843ISK_3d.cfg" configuration file to one that works with the ODS point cloud demo. 
    - Flash the IWR6843ISK-ODS with the ODS point cloud binary. 
    - Run the demo as documented for 6843ISK EVM.


3. To bring up the move_base and fake_localization nodes and load a prebuilt map using the
octomap_server, open a new terminal window on the remote machine, ssh into the TurtleBot
laptop and run the following command: 
  ```
  $ roslaunch turtlebot_mmwave_launchers radar_navigation.launch
  ```

  **Note 1**: By default, this launch file loads a specific prebuilt map file containing a map of a simple
rectangular space roughly 4ft x 6ft which can be used to make the robot stay within a space of that
size for demo and testing purposes.
    * To load your own map, edit the radar_navigation.launch file and change the map filename shown in
bold below to your own saved map file.  
  *node name="octomap_server" pkg="octomap_server" type="octomap_server_node" args**="$(find
turtlebot_mmwave_launchers)/launch/map_4ft_by_6ft_border_large.bt** projected_map:=map" />*
  
  * Alternatively, this static map can be completely disabled/removed as follows if desired to allow the
robot to plan paths freely without any artificial boundaries.
    * Remove the line containing “costmap_2d::StaticLayer” in the global_costmap_params.yaml
and local_costmap_params.yaml param files
    * Remove the line containing “octomap_server_node” in the ~catkin_ws/src/turtlebot_mmwave_launchers/launch/radar_navigation.launch file
    * The size of the global and local costmaps can also be increased in the global_costmap_params.yaml and local_costmap_params.yaml param files to allow setting goals that are farther away

  **Note2**: You may see “octree is empty” warnings when there are no objects detected in front of the mmWave sensor.
  
4. Open a new terminal window on the remote machine and run the following command which will
open a pre-defined Rviz configuration customized for the navigation demo.
  * To show the inflation layer which is used for path planning (the command is all one line):
  ```
  $ rosrun rviz rviz -d ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot_mmwave_launchers/launch/navigation_visualization.rviz
  ```
  * To not show the inflation layer which is used for path planning (the command is all one line):
  ```
  $ rosrun rviz rviz -d ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot_mmwave_launchers/launch/navigation_visualization_2.rviz
  ```
  * Alternatively, you can run the following command to open a blank Rviz screen and then manually add the same topics to the visualization as follows:
  ```
  $ rosrun rviz rviz
  ```
    * “Add” three Map displays, one PointCloud2, the Robot Model, and one PosewithCovariance. Use the
	Topic dropdowns on the displays you added in Rviz to select topics for each one. 
      * For the maps, choose “map” for one and the local and global cost maps for the other two. 
	  * Select /initialpose for PosewithCovariance. 
	  * You can select /mmWaveDataHdl/RScan or /xyzi_filt_out for the PointCloud2.
	    * Changing the Size to 0.03, Style to Spheres, and Decay to 0.25 will improve the PointCloud2 visualization. 
	  * You can also add two Path topics (one for /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/local_plan and one for /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/global_plan) and a Polygon for /move_base/local_costmap/footprint.

  * There is also an alternate pre-defined Rviz configuration file as an additional visualization example
  located at “turtlebot_mmwave_launchers/launch/navigation_visualization_2.rviz” that adds a PointCloud for the voxel grid (/move_base/local_costmap/obstacle_layer/marked_cloud) and disables the costmaps.

5. Start the navigation by first providing an initial pose estimate. Select 2D Pose Estimate (along the
top of screen) and click on the location where the TurtleBot is within the map and drag in the
direction it is facing. You should see the TurtleBot appear on the same spot you click immediately
after releasing.
Note: Please do not choose a starting position or goal that is too close to the boundaries of the
current map as the navigation stack will not be able to create what it considers to be a valid path.
6. Now, give the TurtleBot a navigation goal by selecting 2D Nav Goal and clicking the location you
would like the TurtleBot to navigate towards and dragging in the direction you would like it to face.
The TurtleBot should then begin navigation to its goal. If you need to stop it, terminate the
radar_navigation.launch roslaunch command by clicking on the terminal window that was used to
launch it and pressing CTRL-C.

7. As an alternative to manually specifying the initial pose and goal using Rviz, there is also an example
shell script in the “turtlebot_mmwave_launchers/scripts” directory that you can call from the Linux
command prompt to set the initial pose and goal. It is intended to be used with the default 4ft x 6ft
prebuilt map where you start the robot on one of three starting points (a, b, or c) at one end of the
rectangular space facing the opposite end and then send it to one of the three goal points at the
other end. This is useful for demonstrating obstacle avoidance in a 4ft x 6ft space as shown in the
following picture. To run the script, go to the “turtlebot_mmwave_launchers/scripts” directory and
type “./start_nav.sh” at the Linux prompt.
